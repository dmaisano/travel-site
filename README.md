# Travel Site

Website I am working on (wip) to be added to my portofolio. Made using [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for dev tools and task handling.

***
Note: Should be completed by the next week or two with ample time
